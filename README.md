# Sequence

A windows GUI program that is intended to help sequencing validation in molecure cloning experiments. It allows you to use regular expression to select a group of sequencing files and easily process them for down-stream analysis.

Executable could be found in the [release page](https://github.com/jyh1/sequence/releases/tag/v1.01).
